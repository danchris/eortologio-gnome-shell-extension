# Eortologio Gnome Shell Extension
Simple gnome extension to display the greek namedays. Shows only the namedays of current day (today). Also, names are in Greek.


# How it works
Alongside with the source code, a json file with most of greek namedays acts as the database. This file called `recurring_namedays.json` and I found it on [Greek-namedays](https://github.com/alexstyl/Greek-namedays) repo, so special thanks to [@alexstyl](https://github.com/alexstyl).

Currently, eortologio extension does not support namedays depend on Easter.
