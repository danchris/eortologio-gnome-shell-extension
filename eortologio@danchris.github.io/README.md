# Eortologio Gnome Shell Extension
Simple gnome extension to display the greek namedays. Shows only the namedays of current day (today). Also, names are in Greek.


# How it works
Alongside with the source code, two json files with most of greek namedays act as the database. These files called `recurring_namedays.json` and `relative_to_easter.json` and I found it on [Greek-namedays](https://github.com/alexstyl/Greek-namedays) repo. Special thanks to [@alexstyl](https://github.com/alexstyl) for his great work.

Some namedays may missing.
